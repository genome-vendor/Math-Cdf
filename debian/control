Description: Generate probabilities and quantiles from several 
 Math::CDF provides a perl interface to the DCDFLIB. See the section on
 DCDFLIB for more information.
 .
 Functions are available for 7 continuous distributions (Beta, Chi-square, F,
 Gamma, Normal, Poisson and T-distribution) and for two discrete distributions
 (Binomial and Negative Binomial). Optional non-centrality parameters are
 available for the Chi-square, F and T-distributions. Cumulative probabilities
 are available for all 9 distributions and quantile functions are available
 for the 7 continuous distributions.
 .
 All cumulative probability function names begin with the character "p". They
 give the probability of being less than or equal to the given value [ P(X <=
 x) ]
 .
